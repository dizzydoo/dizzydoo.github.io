    <p>Introduction:	
The	purpose	of	this	lab	is	to	continue	students’	introduction	to	HTML5	and	CSS,	while	encouraging	
students	to	actively	engage	with	the	content.	The	important	concept	here	is	to	introduce	basic	concepts	
that	will	serve	as	a	foundation	for	researching	and	implementing	more	complex	functionality.		
NB:	Continuing	from	the	completed	Lab	1.	Also	this	lab	is	designed	for	you	to	utilize	resources	such	as	
W3schools,	Tutorial	Point	and	MDN	as	resources	to	complete	these	activities.
